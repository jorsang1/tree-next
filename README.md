# tree-next  
Exercice to implement a "Next" method as an extension for a basic tree implementation  
  
## Description  
I do the exercise as a TDD kata.  
I do a commit for each test with the implementation.  
And I do a separate commit for each refactor applied after the test.  
  
## Considerations  
I name the test projects the same name as the original project we are testing with the suffix ".Test".  
I name the test classes with the same name as the original with the suffix "Test".  
The name "sut" is a convention that means "subject under test".  
Test names are following the convention [Method]_WHEN_[Test conditions]_THEN_[expected result].
